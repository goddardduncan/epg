**NineNow Sniffer**

Want to get your own personal 9now links sniffed daily?<br><br>

If you have a location on GitHub you have access to and a token to access your GitHub, 
then you can install the scraper extension.  Fill in those details in the options and it will scrape your personal 
m3u8 links w/ tokens every 20 hours.<br><br>  

You probably won't even notice it when (every 20 hours) it opens the windows systematically to each of the channel 9 channels, waits for your tokenised m3u8 links to appear in your browser, saves 
them and then uploads them to your github. <br><br>**It's what I use here for 9now.json**
