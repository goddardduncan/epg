**NineNow Sniffer**

Want to get your own personal 9now links sniffed daily?<br><br>

If you have a location on GitHub you have access to and a token to access your GitHub, 
then you can use the scraper extension to sniff your personal m3u8 links.  Fill in those details in the options and the extension will scrape your personal m3u8 links w/ tokens every 20 hours and update them in your chosen location.<br><br>  

Every 20 hours it opens the windows systematically to each of the channel 9 channels, waits for your tokenised m3u8 links to appear in your browser, saves them and then uploads them to your github. <br><br>

**It's what I use here for 9now.json**
