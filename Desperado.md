**Watch Melbourne TV from your browser**<br><br>
Wrecked our TV receppo with cheap lights from Bunnings.  Decided to cut the cable and go IPTV.  This is a wrapper on [Matt](https://www.matthuisman.nz/)'s work.<br><br>

This EPG is designed for a wireless remote so the buttons are fit for purpose.<br>
**Up** and **down** keypresses select channel.  Press **enter** on a selected channel to open the stream.  Alternatively, **select/click** an icon to open the stream.<br><br>

While watching: **Enter** plays. **Up** shows program info.  **Down** mutes. **Left** moves a channel up in the guide.  **Right** moves a channel down in the guide.  **Escape** returns to the last channel you selected FROM the EPG.  **Home** returns you to the EPG.  **Context Menu** toggles subtitles.<br><br>

You might notice that if you use left or right keypresses from the guide, it takes you to new channel lists.  If you want to use the Pluto sport and movie channels, install the **DeeGee HLS playback** extension to chrome extensions in developer mode.  Then you can press **left** or **right** from the guide to watch these new channels.  Without the extension, selecting one of these channels downloads an m3u8 file.<br><br>

The extension is a modified version of **Native HLS playback** but has modifications to keypress behaviour while watching these channels.
