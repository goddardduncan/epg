**Watch Melbourne TV from your browser**<br><br>
Wrecked our TV receppo with cheap lights from Bunnings.  Decided to cut the cable and go IPTV.  This is a wrapper on [Matt](https://www.matthuisman.nz/)'s work.<br><br>

This EPG is designed for a wireless remote so the buttons are fit for purpose.<br>
**Up** and **down** keypresses select channel.  Press **enter** on a selected channel to open the stream.  Alternatively, **select/click** an icon to open the stream<br><br>

While watching: **Up** shows program info.  **Down** mutes. **Left** moves a channel up in the guide.  **Right** moves a channel down in the guide.  **Escape** returns to the last channel you selected FROM the EPG.  **Home** returns you to the EPG.<br><br>

If you want to use the Pluto sport and movie channels, install the **DeeGee HLS playback** extension to chrome extensions in developer mode.  Then you can press **left** or **right** from the guide to move to these new channels.
